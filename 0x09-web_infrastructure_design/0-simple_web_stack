- Server is a dedicated computer hosted on a networking, responding to requests.
- The domain name reference the ip address of the server.
- www in www.foobar.com is a CNAME record for foobar.com
- The web server hosts and serves web content.
- The application server handles and responds to business logic requests.
- The role of the database is to persist data throughout the architecture.
- The server uses HTTP to communicate with the client.

Issues
- SPOF (Single Point of Failure):
	The whole architecture is dependent on the server and a single failure in any of the server components will cause total failure.
- Downtime when maintenance is needed:
	During maintenance, the whole app is in halt due to a single server.
- Cannot scale if to much incoming traffic:
	This web architecture cannot withstand high traffic due to the presence of a single server.
